# 🛡️ PAN Card Tampering Detection

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that detects tampering in PAN card images using **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** and image processing techniques.

The app compares a suspected PAN card against a reference/original template and highlights differences using bounding boxes, difference maps, and binary threshold masks.
